字符串
===

#### 6.1、字符串使用单引号 `''`

```javascript
// bad
const name = "Capt. Janeway";

// good
const name = 'Capt. Janeway';
```
#### 6.2、字符串超过 80 个字节应该使用字符串连接号换行。


#### 6.3、 注：过度使用字串连接符号可能会对性能造成影响。

```javascript
// bad
const errorMessage = 'This is a super long error that was thrown because of Batman. When you stop to think about how Batman had anything to do with this, you would get nowhere fast.';

// bad
const errorMessage = 'This is a super long error that was thrown because \
of Batman. When you stop to think about how Batman had anything to do \
with this, you would get nowhere \
fast.';

// good
const errorMessage = 'This is a super long error that was thrown because ' +
  'of Batman. When you stop to think about how Batman had anything to do ' +
  'with this, you would get nowhere fast.';
```
#### 6.4、程序化生成字符串时，使用模板字符串代替字符串连接。

>	为什么？
	模板字符串更为简洁，更具可读性。

```javascript
  // bad
  function sayHi(name) {
    return 'How are you, ' + name + '?';
  }

  // bad
  function sayHi(name) {
    return ['How are you, ', name, '?'].join();
  }

  // good
  function sayHi(name) {
    return `How are you, ${name}?`;
  }
```
